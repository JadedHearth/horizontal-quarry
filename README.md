# Horizontal Quarry

A small turtle digging program I may or may not finish for the [CC:Tweaked](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked) Minecraft mod, intended for use with Lapito's Galacticraft modpack.
I have to upload the code for testing to pastebin, so you can find the latest code for the turtles [here](pastebin.com/MRGKkJVL) and [here](pastebin.com/f1PWM7hW). Note that the code there will most likely not work (;

Created by StarNinga, inspired by parts of @Helldragger's CC-Plethora-Scripts "fly.lua" and parts of the ComputerCraft defualt program "quarry".
