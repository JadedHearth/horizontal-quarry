# Horizontal Quarry

A small turtle digging program I may or may not finish for the [https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked]CC:Tweaked Minecraft mod.

## Completed:
* Digging back-and-forth in rows 3 blocks tall capability
* Returns to the chest when inventory is full

## Todo:
* Central terminal to control multiple turtles (rednet)
* Automatically place torches to light up the hole (check if there is water)
* Have them use the entirety of the loading area of ChickenChunks
